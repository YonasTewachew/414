Passing Network Analysis Script
This script analyzes a single soccer match passing network using StatsBomb open-data.
It filters for one teamâ€™s successful passes, builds a directed graph,
computes centrality measures, and visualizes the passing network.

Usage:
    Ensure you have cloned the StatsBomb open-data repository as described above.
    Then run: python passing_network.py
